# Project Vending Machine [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/eceusc/project-vending-machine.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/eceusc/project-vending-machine) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-%23project--vending--machine-%234d394b.svg?style=flat&logo=slack&link=https%3A%2F%2Feceopensource.slack.com%2Fmessages%2FCF90BHRAM)

A vending machine powered by open source contributions! :atm:

## About

We plan to create an actual, phyical vending machine where you can pay for items with open source contributions on our [@eceusc](https://www.github.com/eceusc) GitHub organization!

The "open source contributions" will be powered by a Django app that listen to the GitHub API for issues and pull requests created by users. The vending machine will made with a Rasperry Pi that controls an Arduino to dispense items. We will build a webapp that users can use to login and "buy" items.

## Structure

This repo is empty as of now (bc the project hasn't started yet), but this repo will be divided into several parts. For example, there will be directories called `/arduino`, `/rasberry-pi`, `/web-app`, etc. Each directory will have their own contribution guides.
